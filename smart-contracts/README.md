## üåü Overview

PoolFi is a decentralized collaborative savings platform that enables groups of people to collectively save towards common financial goals. Built on the Reef Network, it provides a secure, transparent, and efficient way for communities to pool their resources.

### Key Features

- **Pool Creation**: Create savings pools with customizable parameters
- **Member Management**: Join pools and track member contributions
- **Contribution System**: Make fixed-amount contributions to pools
- **Automatic Completion**: Pools automatically complete when targets are reached
- **Fund Withdrawal**: Members can withdraw their contributions from completed pools
- **Platform Fees**: Configurable platform fees for sustainability
- **Emergency Controls**: Pause/unpause functionality for emergency situations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The PoolFi smart contract system consists of multiple contracts designed for different use cases:

```
PoolFi Smart Contract System
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PoolManager.sol      # Main contract with full functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BasicPool.sol        # Simplified version for testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MinimalPool.sol      # Ultra-lightweight version
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MockREEF.sol         # Mock token for testing
```

## üìÑ Contracts

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd poolfi/smart-contracts
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   REEF_RPC_URL=https://rpc.reefscan.com
   REEF_CHAIN_ID=13939
   ```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploy to Reef Network

1. **Compile contracts:**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Deploy to Reef Pelagia testnet:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:pelagia
   ```

4. **Deploy to Reef mainnet:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:mainnet
   ```

### Deployment Scripts

- `deploy.js` - Deploy all contracts
- `deploy-basic.js` - Deploy BasicPool only
- `deploy-minimal.js` - Deploy MinimalPool only
- `deploy-reef.js` - Deploy MockREEF token

## üß™ Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/PoolManager.test.js

# Run tests with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npx hardhat coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- Contract deployment
- Pool creation and management
- Member joining and leaving
- Contribution handling
- Fund withdrawal
- Admin functions
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Gas optimization

## üìñ Usage

### Creating a Pool

```solidity
// Create a new savings pool
uint256 poolId = await poolManager.createPool(
    "Vacation Fund",           // Pool name
    "Saving for summer trip",  // Description
    ethers.parseEther("100"),  // Target amount (100 REEF)
    ethers.parseEther("10"),   // Contribution amount (10 REEF)
    10,                        // Max members
    deadline                   // Deadline timestamp
);
```

### Joining a Pool

```solidity
// Join an existing pool
await poolManager.joinPool(poolId);
```

### Making a Contribution

```solidity
// Make a contribution (must be exact amount)
await poolManager.contribute(poolId, { 
    value: ethers.parseEther("10") 
});
```

### Withdrawing Funds

```solidity
// Withdraw funds from completed pool
await poolManager.withdrawFunds(poolId);
```

## üîí Security

### Security Features

- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Ownable**: Access control for admin functions
- **Pausable**: Emergency pause functionality
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
- **Safe Math**: Overflow/underflow protection

### Security Considerations

- All external calls are protected with ReentrancyGuard
- Input validation prevents invalid operations
- Access control ensures only authorized users can perform sensitive operations
- Emergency pause allows quick response to security issues
- Platform fees are capped to prevent excessive charges

### Audit Recommendations

Before mainnet deployment, consider:
- Professional security audit
- Formal verification
- Bug bounty program
- Community review

## üìä Gas Optimization

### Optimizations Implemented

- Packed structs for efficient storage
- Batch operations where possible
- Minimal external calls
- Efficient event logging
- Optimized loops and conditions

### Gas Usage Estimates

| Function | Gas Cost (approx.) |
|----------|-------------------|
| createPool | 180,000 |
| joinPool | 45,000 |
| contribute | 35,000 |
| withdrawFunds | 30,000 |

## üîß Configuration

### Network Configuration

The contracts are configured for Reef Network:

- **Mainnet**: Chain ID 13939
- **Testnet**: Chain ID 13940
- **Pelagia**: Chain ID 13939 (testnet)

### Hardhat Configuration

```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.20",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200,
      },
    },
  },
  networks: {
    reefMainnet: {
      url: "https://rpc.reefscan.com",
      chainId: 13939,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
    // ... other networks
  },
};
```

## üìà Monitoring

### Events

All major operations emit events for monitoring:

- `PoolCreated` - When a new pool is created
- `MemberJoined` - When a user joins a pool
- `ContributionMade` - When a contribution is made
- `PoolCompleted` - When a pool reaches its target
- `FundsWithdrawn` - When funds are withdrawn
