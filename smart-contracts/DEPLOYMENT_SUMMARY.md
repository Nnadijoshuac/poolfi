## ‚ö†Ô∏è Reef Pelagia Testnet Issues

### Current Status
- ‚ùå **CodeRejected Error**: All contract deployments fail on Reef Pelagia testnet
- ‚ùå **Error Details**: `Module(ModuleError { index: 54, error: [27, 0, 0, 0], message: Some("CodeRejected") })`

### Possible Causes
1. **Network Restrictions**: Reef Pelagia might have specific contract size or complexity limits
2. **Compiler Version**: Reef network might require specific Solidity compiler versions
3. **Gas Settings**: Network might have different gas requirements
4. **Contract Dependencies**: OpenZeppelin contracts might not be compatible with Reef
5. **Network Configuration**: The RPC endpoint might have specific requirements

## üìÅ Files Created

### Configuration Files
- `hardhat.config.js` - Main Hardhat configuration
- `hardhat.config.reef.js` - Reef-specific configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

### Deployment Scripts
- `scripts/deployAll.js` - Deploy all 5 contracts
- `scripts/deployReef.js` - Reef-specific deployment
- `scripts/deployReefSimple.js` - Simplified Reef deployment
- `scripts/deployAndInteract.js` - Deploy and test contracts

### Interaction Scripts
- `scripts/interact.js` - Interact with deployed contracts
- `scripts/simpleTest.js` - Basic contract testing

### Contract Files
- `contracts/MockREEF.sol` - Mock REEF token
- `contracts/BasicPool.sol` - Basic pool functionality

- `contracts/PoolManager.sol` - Full-featured pool manager
- `contracts/SimplePoolManager.sol` - Simplified pool manager

## üöÄ How to Use

### Local Development
```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy all contracts locally
npx hardhat run scripts/deployAll.js --network hardhat

# Deploy and test contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deployAndInteract.js --network hardhat

# Interact with contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network hardhat
```

### Reef Pelagia Deployment (When Fixed)
```bash
# Try Reef deployment
npx hardhat run scripts/deployReef.js --config hardhat.config.reef.js --network reefPelagia

# Simple Reef deployment
npx hardhat run scripts/deployReefSimple.js --config hardhat.config.reef.js --network reefPelagia
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Reef Pelagia Issues

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Contact Reef Support**
   - The "CodeRejected" error suggests network-level restrictions
   - Contact Reef team for specific deployment requirements

2. **Try Different Contract Versions**
   - Deploy contracts one by one to identify which ones are rejected
   - Start with the simplest contract (SimplePoolManager)

3. **Alternative Deployment Methods**
   - Use Reef's native deployment tools
   - Try deploying through Reef's web interface
   - Use different RPC endpoints

4. **Contract Optimization**
   - Reduce contract size by removing unused functions
   - Split large contracts into smaller ones
   - Use proxy patterns for upgradeable contracts

5. **Network Configuration**
   - Verify the RPC endpoint is correct and accessible
   - Check if the network requires specific gas settings
   - Ensure the private key has sufficient permissions

## üìä Contract Details

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Resolve Reef Pelagia Issues**
   - Contact Reef support for deployment guidance
